# 📁 Scripts Consolidation Complete

## ✅ Problem Solved

**Issue**: There were two `scripts` folders causing confusion:
- `/scripts/` (root level)
- `/boilerplate/scripts/` (inside boilerplate)

## 🔄 Changes Made

### 1. **Moved All Scripts to Boilerplate**
- ✅ Moved `deploy.js` from `/scripts/` to `/boilerplate/scripts/`
- ✅ Moved `auto-generator.ts` from `/scripts/` to `/boilerplate/scripts/`
- ✅ Moved `end-to-end-test.js` from `/scripts/` to `/boilerplate/scripts/`
- ✅ Moved `test-enhanced-cli.js` from `/scripts/` to `/boilerplate/scripts/`
- ✅ Moved `typescript-auto-generator.js` from `/scripts/` to `/boilerplate/scripts/`
- ✅ Removed duplicate/empty `auto-generator.js` from root
- ✅ Removed empty `/scripts/` folder

### 2. **Updated Path References**
- ✅ Updated `package.json` deploy script: `"deploy": "node boilerplate/scripts/deploy.js"`
- ✅ Fixed `deploy.js` path resolution: `this.projectRoot = path.resolve(__dirname, '..', '..')`
- ✅ Updated documentation references in `DEPLOYMENT_FLAGS_COMPLETED.md`

### 3. **Verified Functionality**
- ✅ `npm run dev` still works (auto-generator)
- ✅ `npm run deploy --help` works (deployment script)
- ✅ `npm run deploy --dry-run` shows correct paths
- ✅ All path resolutions are correct
